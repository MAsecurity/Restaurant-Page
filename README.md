# Restaurant-Page
## What is this project about?
This project is about a fictional restaurant page named Tasty Pizza, which offers a wide variety of Pizzas as well as some desserts and drinks, This project was built using not only HTML,CSS and JavaScript, but also webpack, a module bundler which takes all my code in the src directory, which is comprised of multiple files and bundles it into one file (main.js) in the dist directory, webpack is also beneficial in the sense that it reduces the number of requests and loading speed.
